# Agile
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end ([Source](http://www.agilenutshell.com/)).

## Values ([Source](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/))
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

## Principles ([Source](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html))
* Our **highest priority** is to **satisfy the customer** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
* Deliver **working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project.
* Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
* **Working software** is the **primary measure** of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development.The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain a constant pace indefinitely**.
* Continuous attention to **technical excellence** and **good design** enhances agility.
* **Simplicity**--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
* At **regular intervals**, the **team reflects** on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
